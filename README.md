# Understanding SOLID Principles in Java

[Understanding SOLID Principles in Java with Real-Life Examples](https://medium.com/@cibofdevs/understanding-solid-principles-in-java-with-real-life-examples-d6fe93b0acc2)

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make \
software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These \
principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin, are widely recognized as the \
foundation for good object-oriented design and programming. The acronym \
SOLID stands for:

- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle \
    Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ensures that each class has only one reason to change, promoting clarity and maintainability by separating responsibilities.

- **P** - Open/Closed Principle \
    Definition: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP) encourages software entities to be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without altering existing code.


- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle \
    Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) emphasizes the use of inheritance and polymorphism in a way that does not break the functionality of the program, fostering robust and interchangeable components.


- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle \
    Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) advocates for the creation of fine-grained interfaces that are client-specific, preventing unnecessary dependencies and promoting code clarity.


- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle \
    Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) promotes loose coupling by ensuring that high-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, enabling easier testing, maintenance, and scalability.
